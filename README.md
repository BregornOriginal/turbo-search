# Turbo Search app

In this application, the user has a list of products. Which are listed and there's an input search bar, where the user can search an item by typing on it.
### The search bar has the following functionality

- While typing after a set time, the app looks in the database products for words typed by the user
- Searches omit symbols, which means if a user types a `good product?` it will search for **good products**
- Searches are saved on the database search_queries table when a `?` it's at the end of the word typed by the user
- Each query saved on the database it's saved by the user that's logged in, so **do not blend** different queries and show good analytics!
